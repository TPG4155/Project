# A numerical study ofpressure diffusion around an impermeable anomaly in an otherwisehomogeneous porous media using a finite difference model

This is a gathering of files used in a group project in the course TPG4155 Applied Computer Methods in Petroleum Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).



Abstract of the report:

EOR is known as the concept of using various techniques for getting as much hydrocarbons as possible out of a reservoir. This has been a large area of focus and investment in the petroleum industry the last couple of years, and it is natural to assume that the
popularity and development within this field will increase in the following
years.

The task of this project will be working with a numerical study of pressure diffusion around an impermeable anomaly in an otherwise homogeneous porous media using a finite difference model. Specifically, the study will investigate slanted shale slabs at different angles and a spherical anomaly representing an unknown object. 

Results include simulations of pressure distribution done on different reservoir-like models, and graphs made to give a deeper understanding to the outcome of the simulations. These will collectively contribute to the knowledge of how pressure is distributed in specific sections of a reservoir, and give a better understanding of how to produce petroleum more effectively.
