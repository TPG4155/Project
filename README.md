Abstract of the report:

Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) is known as the concept of using various techniques for getting as much hydrocarbons as possible out of a reservoir. This has been a large area of focus and investment in the petroleum industry for several decades, and it is natural to assume that the popularity and development within this field will increase in the following years. The task of this analysis will be to work with a numerical study of pressure diffusion around an impermeable anomaly in an otherwise homogeneous porous media using a finite difference model. Specifically, the study will investigate  slanted  shale  slabs  at  different  angles  and  a  circular  anomaly representing some unknown object. This will be a qualitative study of the principle behaviour of pressure diffusion with certain boundary conditions. Results include simulations of pressure diffusion done on different reservoir-like models, and graphs made to give a deeper understanding of the outcomefrom the simulations. These will collectively contribute to the knowledge of how pressure is diffused in specific sections of a reservoir, and give a better understanding of how to produce more effectively.
